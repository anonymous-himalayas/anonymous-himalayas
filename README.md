### Discord Bots:
I recently got into creating simple Discord bots:
- [Birthday Bot](https://github.com/anonymous-himalayas/birthday-bot), stores all my friends birthdays because I have too many friends
- [Reminder Bot](https://github.com/anonymous-himalayas/reminder-bot), stores all my reminders

Why can't I use a reminders app on my phone for all this? Because Discord is cooler
